This repository contains a dataset consisting of ~36K reservations (data points) and 19 features. The data set is open source and comes from the Kaggle page "Hotel Reservations Dataset" [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-dataset]. The features include information about the data the reservation is made, number of nights stayed, number of adults/children, room type, and the whether or not the reservation was canceled.

In hotel_cancellation_GBT.ipynb, we trained decision tree (DT) and gradient boosted tree (GBT) to predict whether a reservation would be canceled or not. The models were trained using a 5-fold cross-validation on an 80/20 training/testing split. For both the DT and GBT models we use GridSearchCV to perform the cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

The GBT model predicted with ~90% accuracy, while the DT model predicted with ~87% accuracy. In both cases the most important feature was the lead_time (the time from the reservation is made until the actual reservation).
